Similar structure as DeepSpot. Install SEQUOIA virtual environment using their instructions [here](https://github.com/gevaertlab/sequoia-pub/blob/master/README.md). Their requirements.txt file does not work, try the requirements.txt file in this [folder](https://github.com/jantaohk/Deepspot-implementation/blob/main/sequoia/requirements.txt). Clone their repo.  
Most of the py files are taken directly from SEQUOIA's repo, some of them with modifications made, usually denoted by ### (three hashes). Many comments added for interpretability. Replace SEQUOIA's files from their cloned repo with the corresponding py files found in this folder. Some areas use absolute file paths and would require changing. They should be denoted by ######## (>5 hashs)
Then run run.py. This is a wrapper that runs functions extracted from utils2. utils2 is custom made, and is also a wrapper itself that runs each step in the workflow, in the terminal. Each step should be able to run independently through specifying in the parser in run.py, but they should be run sequentially. The sequence can be found as the default argument in the parser   
miscellaneous.ipynb contains code for some graphs presented in final meeting  
info_generation.py creates the lookup table of file paths of all relevant ground truth data of the 109 images. This is very important as run.py and the creation of ref_file.csv rely on the existence of this lookup table.
