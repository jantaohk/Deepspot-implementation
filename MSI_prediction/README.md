MSI_prediction  
uni.ipynb produces the results for using UNI model. Use SEQUOIA's virtual environment  
conch.ipynb produces the results for using CONCHv1.5. Use DeepSpot's virtual environment
To get predictions, the code should be run sequentially from top to bottom. Some cells at the bottom of uni.ipynb are just for checking intermediate outputs
To extract patches and features for conch.ipynb, you would have to clone TRIDENT and run run_batch_of_slides.py in  using the bash script provided by the fourth cell in conch.ipynb
